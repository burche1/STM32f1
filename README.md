# STM32f1
Embedded_Learning

Directory used to compile several projects about programming in STM21F10X micro processors.

Goals:

- GPIO -> OK
- TIM Interrupt -> OK
- EXT Iterrupt -> OK
- Better use of memory on Button Input -> OK (sagui_example.c) -> OK
- ADC Button -> OK (With potentiometer)
- UART polling -> OK
- UART interrupt -> OK (need to better understand)
- USART -> on hold
- DHT11 (data is a serial output) 
- I2C -> ongoing
- SPI -> ongoing

Projects are created on IAR Embedded Workbench 8.30.1

After that, goal is also to use Eclipse IDE.
