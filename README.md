# STM32f1
Embedded_Learning

Directory used to compile several projects about programming in STM21F10X micro processors.

Objectives:
- GPIO -> OK
- TIM Interrupt -> OK
- EXT Iterrupt -> OK
- Better use of memory on Button Input -> ongoing (sagui_example.c)
- ADC Button -> ongoing
- USART
- I2C

Projects are created on IAR Embedded Workbench 8.30.1

After that, object is also to use Eclipse IDE.
